Write a JavaScript script that adds a dynamic phone number formatting to an HTML form. This form includes an input field for mobile numbers. When a user types into this field, your script should automatically format the input to match the phone number pattern (123) 456-7890.

The input should reflect the formatting even when fewer than 10 digits are entered. Only digits from 0-9 are allowed in the input.
For example, if a user inputs "123456", the input field should automatically update to show "(123) 456". If the user continues typing "7890", the input field should update to "(123) 456-7890".
