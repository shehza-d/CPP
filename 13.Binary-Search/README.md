# [Binary Search Beginner to Advanced | C++, Java, Python | Notes + Contest](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgUwDviBIf0pMFMWuuvDNMAkoQFi-h0ZF)

After reviewing many comments on the already existing playlists, we found that people were facing the following issues:

- When to use low (less than) high and low (less than equals) high
- Binary search with decimal answers
- When to use low = mid + 1 or low = mid
- How to know if low or high will be the answer in the end
- Code reuse, which is essential for good code quality

We backed up all the lectures with high-quality articles, which has C++, Java, Python and JS codes. During the lectures, I write pseudo codes, so that any one can watch it.
